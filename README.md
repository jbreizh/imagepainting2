# ImagePainting2

## Introduction

New version of [ImagePainting](https://github.com/jbreizh/ImagePainting), but i want to keep the first version. So here is the second version.

Basically the same, the main difference is that i give up the smartphone app :

* Phonegap is dead (so no easy way to compile it for android)

* iOS is so closed that i can't make an app without paying....

Now the frontend is directly store and serve by the ESP8266 as a webpage. It work for any device with a decent browser (computer, android and iOS....).

Everything seems to work with the last board/tool/library upgrade (july 2023).

## Description

Existing DIY project like Adafruit [NeoPixel Painter](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-painter/overview) or [DotStar Pi Painter](https://learn.adafruit.com/dotstar-pi-painter/overview) and also commercial project like [Pixelstick](http://www.thepixelstick.com/index.html) or [Magilight](https://www.fotorgear.com/products/magilight) have been a great source of inspiration/information, but i find those too complicated to build and/or too expensive.

ImagePainting2 is project of a lightPainting device aiming to be powerfull but yet simple and cheap to build and to use. All you need is an USB battery bank, a LED Strip, an ESP8266 board and a smartphone (any device with wifi and a browser).

After a simple [electronic wiring](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/electronic-wiring), adapting the [ESP8266 code](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/ESP8266-code) and finally following the [flash instruction](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/Flash-instruction), you will have a lightPainting device that you can control with your [smartphone](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/User-Manual) to shoot [great picture](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/examples).
